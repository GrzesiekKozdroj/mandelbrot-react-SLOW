This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

using code from https://github.com/agm1984/mandelbrot i edited and copy pasted it into react app. I plan to further modify it and if one day machine will be able to even animate it.

to see "working" example please visit:

it takes 12 seconds on my laptop to render image. It may take shorter or longer on your machine.
